In 2019, the city of Seattle saw more than 3000 injuries including 25 fatalities caused by vehicle collisions. Learning which conditions are risk factors that elicit more severe accidents and therefore cause more fatalities and serious injuries is crucial. \n\nThis analysis will try to find models to predict when accidents are prone to becoming more dangerous. The city will then be able to adjust and develop traffic-related policies and prevention operations accordingly. "

Where applicable, the data also showes if the driver was speeding, under the influence or inattentive. \n\nIn total (and grouped by severity) the records show the following accidents:\n\n|Severity of Accident  | Total count |\n| ------------- |------------- |\n|Property Damage Only Collision  |  137,485 |\n|Injury Collision           |        58,698 |\n|Unknown                  |          21,636 |\n|Serious Injury Collision      |      3,098 |\n|Fatality Collision            |        349 |\n\nThis analysis will examin the factors that contribute to accidents becoming more severe and develope a model to predict when the risk for serious injuries and fatalities is high."
